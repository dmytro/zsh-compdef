Various ZSH completion scripts. These require http://www.zsh.org/ and
must be located in a $fpath directory, for example under
~/.zsh/functions via the following in the ~/.zshrc config file:

  fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)

For more info on ZSH completion, consult:

or try #zsh on the Freenode IRC network (where we will likely point you
at the above and other docs).
